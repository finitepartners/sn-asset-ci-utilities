# Asset and CI Utilities

![Alt](docs/img/finite-logo-75.png "Finite Logo")

## Summary
This is a set of 3 simple utilities created to help make the management of CI and Asset relationships easier.  ServiceNow places restrictions on modifying Model Categories after initial creation. This application provides a user-friendly way to run scripts in the background that update model categories, bypassing ServiceNow's OOB restrictions.

It also provides for easily creating CIs for all of the Assets in a particular category.

Use at your own risk, as this violates ServiceNow's design for Asset & CI Categories -- however I've personally found this to be an extremely useful tool when working to improve a client's Asset Management implementation.
